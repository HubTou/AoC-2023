# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
This is a repository of personal notes and solutions to this coding tournament / challenge.

## Why not publishing puzzle texts and user inputs?
As mentioned on [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about): 
> Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code? Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy.
> If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.

## Competitive programming and leaderboard
As a first participation, I was not at all in the competitive mindset, but found the exercise rather interesting.

I see that a library to ease the processing of input data and automate entry submission could be useful. For example, the first player in the leaderboard used one for Kotlin.

The competition is now over. The [top players](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard) were all incredible!

Check the time it took them to get the first and both stars:

## Interesting notes and solutions elsewhere
Half of the top 100 leaders have a GitHub account, and one third of them have published their AoC 2023 code.

Among them, I noticed [Jonathan Paulson (#5) Python solutions](https://github.com/jonathanpaulson/AdventOfCode/tree/master/2023), and [mrphlip (#27) commented Python solutions](https://github.com/mrphlip/aoc/tree/master/2023). 

There are some other interesting resources on GitHub, such as a [collection of awesome resources related to the yearly Advent of Code challenge](https://github.com/Bogdanp/awesome-advent-of-code), or on the Web, such as an article about [Solving Your Puzzles With Python](https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/).
