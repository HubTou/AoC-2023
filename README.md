# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
This is a repository of notes and solutions to this coding tournament / challenge.

As a first participation, I was not at all in the competitive mindset, but found the exercise rather interesting.

The competition is now over. The [top players](https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard) were incredible!

Check the time it took them to get the first and both stars:
